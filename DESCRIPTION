Title: Adaptive Dropout Imputer (ADImpute)
Version: 1.1.0
Description: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods are typically unable
    to quantify the expression levels of all genes in a cell, creating a need
    for the computational prediction of missing values (‘dropout imputation’).
    Most existing dropout imputation methods are limited in the sense that they
    exclusively use the scRNA-seq dataset at hand and do not exploit external
    gene-gene relationship information. Here we propose two novel methods: a
    gene regulatory network-based approach using gene-gene relationships learnt
    from external data and a baseline approach corresponding to a sample-wide
    average. ADImpute can implement these novel methods and also combine them
    with existing imputation methods (currently supported: DrImpute, SAVER).
    ADImpute can learn the best performing method per gene and combine the
    results from different methods into an ensemble.
